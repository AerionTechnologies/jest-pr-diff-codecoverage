# Jest PR Diff Code Coverage Check

A GitHub Action that analyzes Jest code coverage for lines changed in a Pull Request and ensures they meet a minimum coverage threshold.

## Features

- âœ… **Precise Coverage Analysis**: Only analyzes coverage for lines that were actually changed in the PR
- ðŸ“Š **Multiple Format Support**: Works with LCOV and Jest JSON coverage formats
- ðŸ’¬ **PR Comments**: Automatically comments on PRs with detailed coverage reports
- ðŸŽ¯ **Configurable Thresholds**: Set your own minimum coverage requirements
- ðŸš« **Optional Failure**: Choose whether to fail the action if coverage is below threshold

## Usage

### Basic Setup

Add this action to your GitHub workflow after running your tests with coverage:

```yaml
name: Test Coverage

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  coverage-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run tests with coverage
      run: npm test -- --coverage
    
    - name: Check PR Code Coverage
      uses: your-username/jest-pr-codecoverage@v1
      with:
        coverage-file: 'coverage/lcov.info'
        minimum-coverage: '80'
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
    - name: Check PR Code Coverage
      uses: your-username/jest-pr-codecoverage@v1
      with:
        coverage-file: 'coverage/coverage-final.json'  # Use Jest JSON format
        minimum-coverage: '85'                         # Require 85% coverage
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        fail-on-coverage-decrease: 'false'            # Don't fail, just report
        comment-on-pr: 'true'                         # Post detailed comment
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `coverage-file` | Path to Jest coverage file (LCOV or JSON format) | Yes | `coverage/lcov.info` |
| `minimum-coverage` | Minimum code coverage percentage (0-100) | Yes | `80` |
| `github-token` | GitHub token for API access | Yes | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `fail-on-coverage-decrease` | Fail the action if coverage is below threshold | No | `true` |
| `comment-on-pr` | Comment coverage results on the PR | No | `true` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `coverage-percentage` | Coverage percentage of changed lines |
| `lines-covered` | Number of changed lines covered by tests |
| `total-lines` | Total number of changed lines |
| `meets-threshold` | Whether the coverage meets the minimum threshold |

## Coverage File Formats

### LCOV Format
Generate LCOV format with Jest:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=lcov
```

This creates `coverage/lcov.info`.

### Jest JSON Format
Generate JSON format with Jest:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=json
```

This creates `coverage/coverage-final.json`.

## How It Works

1. **Parse Coverage Data**: Reads your Jest coverage file (LCOV or JSON format)
2. **Get PR Changes**: Uses GitHub API to get the exact lines changed in the PR
3. **Calculate Coverage**: Determines coverage percentage for only the changed lines
4. **Report Results**: Comments on the PR with detailed results and optionally fails the check

## Example Output

The action will post a comment on your PR like this:

```
## ðŸ“Š Code Coverage Report for Changed Lines

**Overall Coverage:** 85.71% (6/7 lines covered)
**Threshold:** 80%
**Status:** âœ… Passed

### File Coverage Details

| File | Coverage | Lines Changed | Lines Covered |
|------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| src/utils.js | âœ… 100.00% | 3 | 3 |
| src/main.js | âœ… 75.00% | 4 | 3 |
```
